 * the finished signature crosses to us. The key and the password never reach the browser, let
 * alone the server — that is a property of the design, not a promise we keep.
 *
 * Verified against E-IMZO v6.4.7 from an app origin (http://localhost:5103): the socket answers
 * plugin calls with no apikey registration. A public domain may still need a key from NIC —
 * `CAPIWS.apikey(domainAndKey, …)` exists for that — so treat production as unconfirmed.
